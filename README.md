# Editable Angular grid

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.3.

## Features
For demo go to [Angular-CRUD-table](https://ginow.github.io/Angular-CRUD-table/)

This was buit with the help of Angular material table.

### This table is supposed to do the following:
* Filter
* Sort
* Edit (currently only first column can be edited)
* Create (feature under development)
* Delete
* Pagination

## Notes
It retrieves data from webapi service by http get request. For developement purpose the data (stored as json) is retrieved locally from the "assets" folder. 

Column names have been hard-coded, but can be generalised.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
